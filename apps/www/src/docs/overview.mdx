# Introduction to Island AI

Island AI is a collection of TypeScript tools designed to enhance the way developers create user interfaces for AI applications. Moving beyond traditional chat interfaces, it offers more flexibility and power for handling AI-driven interactions.

## Why Island AI?
The idea for Island AI came from the limitations of regular chat interfaces in AI applications. While chat interfaces are familiar, they often limit how we can interact with AI. Island AI aims to change that by allowing more complex and interactive UIs, especially when dealing with real-time data and AI responses.

## Key Features
  - **Handles Complex Data**: Island AI makes it easier to work with structured data in real-time, which is often a challenge in AI applications.
  - **For Modern Web Apps**: With a focus on React, Island AI integrates smoothly into modern web applications, providing tools that are easy to use for developers.
  - **Improves User Experience**: By enabling more dynamic interactions, Island AI helps create interfaces that are more engaging and responsive.

## What's Inside Island AI?
**Island AI includes**:

- Tools for managing structured data with Zod schemas.
- A JSON streaming parser for handling real-time data.
- React hooks for easy integration into web applications.
