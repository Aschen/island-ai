# Concepts: Structured Responses and Partial Streaming

## Structured Responses in Island AI

### What Are Structured Responses?
- **Definition**: In Island AI, structured responses are JSON-formatted data outputs structured according to Zod schemas. These schemas define the expected format of the AI's output, making the data predictable and easy to integrate into various parts of the UI.

- **Application**: Structured responses enable a range of functionalities, from responding to user queries to defining side effects for application execution. They allow for versatile use of the data, such as splitting the response to feed into different UI components.

### Island AI's Approach
- **Abstraction of Complexity**: Island AI abstracts the complexity of tools like OpenAI's functions and JSON mode. You focus on defining the Zod schema for the desired response model, which Island AI uses to handle the output from AI systems efficiently and safely.
